# gba-sp-lcd-noise-comparison
A quick comparison of unwanted noise with different Game Boy LCDs

## Files

You can download this repository from GitHub. These files can be opened with Audacity, a free open-source audio editor. Click "solo" on desired track before playing to listen to that track only.

Each project has two tracks: ````default LCD```` refers to the LCD that came from the factory in my AGS-001. ````FP IPS```` refers to [this aftermarket product](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/gbasp-ips-laminated-display-lcd-kits) from FunnyPlaying.

* ````Advance Wars 2 Sample.aup```` - A short demonstration of booting into a game and playing the soundtrack.
* ````Amplified-Silence.aup```` - A subsection of the AW2 sample, were silence from the game was amplified (edited). IMO, this better demonstrates the high and low buzzing at the level it is percieved in person.

## My findings

* FP IPS noise levels (during silence) are about +2.5dB louder compared to default LCD.
* On my console at least, it manifests as a louder low hum and quieter higher pitched hum.
* Adjusting volume doesn't affect the hum loudness.
* Adjusting brightness barely perceptibly adjusts the higher pitched hum - but you can especially notice the difference when you hear a loud clip when rolling over from max brightness -> min brightness.
